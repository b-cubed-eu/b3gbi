# Calculate Cumulative Species Richness

This function calculates cumulative species richness as a time series
(see 'Details' for more information).

## Usage

``` r
cum_richness_ts(data, ...)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data cube object (class 'processed_cube').

- ...:

  Arguments passed on to
  [`compute_indicator_workflow`](https://b-cubed-eu.github.io/b3gbi/reference/compute_indicator_workflow.md)

  `cell_size`

  :   (Optional) Length of grid cell sides, in km or degrees. Only used
      for maps and for time series that require a grid.

      - `"grid"` (default): use the native resolution of the cube. If
        this would produce more than about 1 million grid cells over the
        study area (for degree-based cubes: if the resolution is finer
        than 1 degree for 'world' or 'continent', or finer than 0.1
        degrees otherwise), you are asked to confirm in an interactive
        session, and the function stops with an error in a
        non-interactive session.

      - `"auto"`: determined automatically. For km-based grids it
        depends on the area of the study region: 100 km for areas of at
        least 1 million sq km, 10 km for at least 10,000 sq km, 1 km for
        at least 100 sq km, and 0.1 km for smaller areas. For
        degree-based grids it is 1 degree for 'world' or 'continent' and
        0.1 degrees otherwise. The automatic size is never smaller than
        the cube's resolution.

      - A number (in the units of the cube's resolution, i.e. km or
        degrees), or for km-based grids a string such as `"10km"` or
        `"500m"`.

      A manually selected cell size must be a whole number multiple of
      the cube's resolution.

  `level`

  :   (Optional) Spatial level: 'cube', 'continent', 'country', 'world',
      'sovereignty', or 'geounit'. (Default: 'cube')

  `region`

  :   (Optional) The region of interest (e.g., "Denmark"). Ignored if
      level is 'cube' or 'world'. (Default: "Europe")

  `ne_type`

  :   (Optional) The type of Natural Earth data to download:
      'countries', 'map_units', 'sovereignty', or 'tiny_countries'. This
      parameter is ignored if level is set to 'cube' or 'world'.
      (Default: "countries")

  `ne_scale`

  :   (Optional) The scale of Natural Earth data to download: 'small' -
      110m, 'medium' - 50m, or 'large' - 10m. (Default: "medium")

  `output_crs`

  :   (Optional) The CRS you want for your calculated indicator. (Leave
      blank to let the function choose a default based on grid reference
      system.)

  `first_year`

  :   (Optional) Exclude data before this year. (Uses all data in the
      cube by default.)

  `last_year`

  :   (Optional) Exclude data after this year. (Uses all data in the
      cube by default.)

  `spherical_geometry`

  :   (Optional) If set to FALSE, will temporarily disable spherical
      geometry while the function runs. Should only be used to solve
      specific issues. (Default is TRUE).

  `make_valid`

  :   (Optional) Calls st_make_valid() from the sf package after
      creating the grid. Increases processing time but may help if you
      are getting polygon errors. (Default is FALSE).

  `shapefile_path`

  :   (optional) Path of an external shapefile to merge into the
      workflow. For example, if you want to calculate your indicator for
      particular features such as protected areas or wetlands.

  `shapefile_crs`

  :   (Optional) CRS of a .wkt shapefile. If your shapefile is .wkt and
      you do NOT use this parameter, the CRS will be assumed to be
      EPSG:4326 and the coordinates will be read in as lat/long. If your
      shape is NOT a .wkt the CRS will be determined automatically.

  `invert`

  :   (optional) Calculate an indicator over the inverse of the
      shapefile (e.g. if you have a protected areas shapefile this would
      calculate an indicator over all non protected areas within your
      cube). Default is FALSE.

  `include_land`

  :   (Optional) Include occurrences which fall within the land area.
      Default is TRUE. Note that this is purely a geographic filter, and
      does not filter based on whether the occurrence is actually
      terrestrial. Grid cells which fall partially on land and partially
      on ocean will be included even if include_land is FALSE. To
      exclude terrestrial and/or freshwater taxa, you must manually
      filter your data cube before calculating your indicator.

  `include_ocean`

  :   (Optional) Include occurrences which fall outside the land area.
      Default is TRUE. Set as "buffered_coast" to include a set buffer
      size around the land area rather than the entire ocean area. Note
      that this is purely a geographic filter, and does not filter based
      on whether the occurrence is actually marine. Grid cells which
      fall partially on land and partially on ocean will be included
      even if include_ocean is FALSE. To exclude marine taxa, you must
      manually filter your data cube before calculating your indicator.

  `buffer_dist_km`

  :   (Optional) The distance to buffer around the land if include_ocean
      is set to "buffered_coast". Default is 50 km.

  `force_grid`

  :   (Optional) Forces the calculation of a grid even if this would not
      normally be part of the pipeline, i.e. for time series. A grid is
      needed for time series of area-based rarity, Hill diversity and
      relative occupancy (and for completeness with
      `gridded_average = TRUE`). This is switched on automatically for
      these indicators: the wrappers
      [`area_rarity_ts()`](https://b-cubed-eu.github.io/b3gbi/reference/area_rarity_map.md),
      [`hill0_ts()`](https://b-cubed-eu.github.io/b3gbi/reference/hill0_map.md),
      [`hill1_ts()`](https://b-cubed-eu.github.io/b3gbi/reference/hill0_map.md)
      and
      [`hill2_ts()`](https://b-cubed-eu.github.io/b3gbi/reference/hill0_map.md)
      already set `force_grid = TRUE`, so do not pass it to them.
      (Default: FALSE)

## Value

An S3 object with the classes 'indicator_ts' and 'cum_richness'
containing the calculated indicator values and metadata.

## Details

### Species richness

Species richness is the total number of species present in a sample
(Magurran, 1988). It is a fundamental and commonly used measure of
biodiversity, providing a simple and intuitive overview of the status of
biodiversity. However, richness is not well suited to measuring
biodiversity change over time, as it only decreases when local
extinctions occur and thus lags behind abundance for negative trends.
While it may act as a leading indicator of alien species invasions, it
will not indicate establishment because it ignores abundance. Nor will
it necessarily indicate changes in local species composition, which can
occur without any change in richness. Although richness is conceptually
simple, it can be measured in different ways.

### Cumulative richness

Cumulative richness is calculated by adding the newly observed unique
species each year to a cumulative sum. This indicator provides an
estimation of whether and how many new species are still being
discovered in a region. While an influx of alien species could cause an
increase in cumulative richness, a fast-rising trend is likely an
indication that the dataset is not comprehensive and therefore observed
richness will provide an underestimate of species richness.
