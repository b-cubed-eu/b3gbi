\title{'processed_cube' S3 Constructor}
\usage{
new_processed_cube(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A tibble data cube containing occurrence data.}
}
\value{
A 'processed_cube' S3 object containing:
  * **Summary statistics:** First and last year of data, coordinate range, number of
    spatial cells, species, and observations.
  * **Diversity information:** Kingdoms represented, resolutions, indication of multiple
    resolutions and datasets, and types of occurrence records.
  * **Original data:** The input data cube.
}
\description{
This function constructs a 'processed_cube' S3 object, a specialized data
structure designed for biodiversity analysis within this package. It validates the input
data cube, calculates essential summary information, and prepares the object for further use.
}
\note{
'processed_cube' objects are used by various analysis functions within this package.

\examples{
# Example assuming your data is in a tibble named 'biodiversity_data'
my_processed_cube <- new_processed_cube(biodiversity_data)
